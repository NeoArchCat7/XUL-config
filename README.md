The XUL-config is a PWA website intended to be a mobile/desktop application for configuring custom DIY MIDI controller XUL.

Download it on chromium-based browsers on [Github Pages](https://neoarchcat7.github.io/XUL-config/)

The app includes next features:

- theme switching
- CC number inputs
- button to send configuration to arduino
- connection with WebSerialApi
- uploading support for computers

Sadly, I couldn't get it to fully work with mobile devices / tablets but it works with desktop.
